Part 1: Morphology

Q1. [5 Marks]
Identify the stems of the following English words:
1. decompose = comp
2. waiting = wait
3. expected = expect
4. snow = now
5. irresistible = resist
6. episodic = sod
Q2. [5 Marks]
Define the following terms and provide examples for each one.
1. Content words = Content words are words that have a meaning and they can be Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, and Adverbs.
Example of content words are, Student, Person, eat, play, gig, loud etc ...
2. function word = Function words are words that are used to support content words examples of function words are Conjunction words 
like and, or, with, Axillary words like will, would, Pronounces like he, she, they.
3) acronym, Acronyms are one part of word formation process. They are created by taking the first letter (letters) of the a phrase and they combined to create a new word that becomes a part of everyday language.
4. inflection


5. derivation
6. root of a word
Root word is the smallest unit of morpheme that can not be splited in to smaller meaningful words. In other words it is the basic unit of morpheme so that we can create other new words using different affixes.
3. suffix = suffix are words or parts of a word that are added at the end of a word. Example -er, s, -able -
4. lexeme = It's the smallest unit of lexicon that has a meaning or a word and its inflected form. Example the verb play can be inflected to plays, played, playing. All these are under the same lexeme.

1. Define the terms derivation and inflection. Which of the following morphemes are derivation and which are inflectional?
Derivation is a word formation process by changing the speech category of the word. Example play is a verb and and player is a noun that is derived from the verb play. Inflection is also a word formation Pronounces but I doesn't change the category of the word, but It can change the grammatical formation. Example play is a verb and plays, played or playing are other words that are  created by inflection of the word play.
(a) -able  = derivation
(b) -ly    = derivation
(c) -s (or -es) = inflection
(d) -ed = inflection
(e) -en = inflection
(f) -er = can be both. Example player is derived from the verb play by adding -er and smaller is inflected from small by adding -er
(g) -ing = inflection

Q4. [5 Marks]
1. What is the tokenizer? Discuss how you could implement a tokenizer and what are the main problems that a tokenizer must tackle for word tokenization?

Q2. [6 Marks]
Translate the following sentences into propositional logic. For every sentence, state under which conditions they are true. Use truth tables!

• A farmer owns a donkey but a baker owns two donkeys. let p = A farmer owns a donkey and q = A baker owns two donkeys
   p or q
• Mary and John are at a party. let p = Mary is at a party and q = John is at a party
   p and q
• If John dances, Mary will not leave the party. let p John dances and q = Mary will leave the party
  p rightarrow neg q
• If it is the case that some women dance or all men sing then Mary walks. Let p some women dance, q = some men sing and r = Mary walks
   p or q rightarrow r


Q3. [7 Marks]
L 1 is a language in first-order logic with the following vocabulary:
• = {john, mary, karl}
• 1 = {P hilosopher}
• 2 = {Loves}
Note: We use j, m and k as abbreviations for the constants and P and L as abbreviations for predicates.
Translate each English sentence into a well-formed formula in L 1 and translate each formula into English.
a. John loves a philosopher.
   P(x) and L(x)(j)
b. Karl only loves philosophers.
  forall x.(P(x) and L(x)(k))
c. Karl doesn’t love anyone.
    neg forall x.(L(x)(k))
d. John loves everyone who Mary doesn’t
   neg forall x.L(x)(m) rightarrow  L(x)(j))
e. ∀x.L(x)(j) → L(x)(m)
     Mary loves everyone who John does. 
f. P(k) ∧ L(j)(k)
   Karl is a philosopher who loves john.
g. P (k)
   Karl is a philosopher


   1
= hD 1 , I 1 i is a model of L 1 defined as follows:
D 1 = {John, Mary, Karl}
I 1 (j) = John
I 1 (p) = Mary
I 1 (m) = Karl
I 1 (P ) =
For all of the formulas from Q3, say whether they are true or false according

a) [[P(x) and L(x)(j)]]^m1
[[P(x) and L(x)(j)]]^M1(x rightarrow l)
P(l) and L(k)(j)
This is as the only philosopher is karl and karl loves john

b) [[forall x.(P(x) and L(x)(k))]]^M1
   [[forall x.(P(x) and L(x)(k))]]^M1(x rightarrow l)
   (P(l) and L(l)(k))
c)  bold [[neg forall x.(L(x)(k))]]^M1
    bold [[(L(x)(k))]]^(M1, x rightarrow l)
    bold (L(l)(k))
d) [[neg forall x.L(x)(m) rightarrow  L(x)(j))]]^M1
   [[L(x)(m) rightarrow  L(x)(j))]]^(M1, x rightarrow l)
   L(l)(m) rightarrow  L(l)(j))
e) bold [[∀x.L(x)(j) → L(x)(m)]]^M1
   bold [[L(x)(j) → L(x)(m)]]^(M1, x rightarrow l)
   bold (L(l)(j) → L(l)(m))

When we say grammar should be formal, we mean it should follow the set of productions rules. Which means the grammar should be context fee and when No matter which symbols surround it, the single nonterminal symbol on the left hand side should  be replaced by the right hand side. 

 the main differences between context-free grammars and context sensitive
grammars?

The main difference between context-free grammars and context sensitive grammar is, in the case context-free grammars, the production rule says that the LHS should be only non-terminal symbols where as in the case of context-sensitive grammar, terminal or non-terminal symbols can be on the LHS.

c. What do you think is the optimal type of formal grammar needed to capture natural language
syntax? Elaborate on your answer.

I think, an optimal type of formal grammar is a grammar that has a set of production rules to apply to translate the language
in to a meaningful set of words or sentences. Therefore, a formal grammar should have finite set of of terminal symbols(the word in the language), a finite set of nonterminal symbols, the set of production rules and the starting sentence or the language we want to produce meaningful translation. Then, we can apply the rules based on the set of production rules for all the input strings (sequences of words).

a. What kind of signifier are words in natural language? Support your answer with examples.
signifier words in natural language are words that can replaced by sign languages examples are open. The word open has different
interpretation based on sign provided with the word. If some one if on near the Gate and If you say open, which means you are telling him to open the door. If the person stands in front  of a his car, the open may refer to open his car.

forall x.forall y.(L(y) and W(x)) rightarrow S(y)(x)

iii. No one is scared of Axel, but Axel is scared of everyone except himself.
neg forall x. (L(x) and S(a)(x)) or forall x.((L(x) and neg L(a) )and S(x)(a))
